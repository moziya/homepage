    Who am I? Jacky Chan? No! Then what? Machine Learning Scientist? Computational Scientist? Data Scientist? Bioinformatician? Statistician? Angler? All correct, but not complete. I got my Bachelor, Master, and Ph.D. in Computer Science, specializing in machine learning, statistical modeling, and time-series analysis. Experienced in developing predictive models and implementing algorithmic solutions for complex data challenges including biological and clinical data. I love to apply analytical and programming skills to drive insights and strategic decision-making from data. And all these related to the quantitative analysis, so I would be rather called as a <b><i>Quantitative Researcher</i></b>. Wait, is fishing a quantitative research problem? Why not! Check my Showcase for the analysis.
